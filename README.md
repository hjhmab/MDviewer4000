### 3-Step Plan for Mastery
 
Follow this structured plan to efficiently move from foundational concepts to architectural design.
 
#### **Step 1: Build the Foundation (The Orchestrator)**
 
* **Action:** Watch Reza Dorrani's video and build along.
* **Objective:** Master the fundamental pattern of a Copilot that performs actions.
* **Task:** Replicate his example, but connect a Power Automate flow to a system you manage (e.g., a SQL database). Focus on successfully passing an input from the chat, executing backend logic, returning the formatted result, and handling potential errors gracefully.
 
#### **Step 2: Extend with Code (The Pro-Developer)**
 
* **Action:** Watch April Dunnam's video on plugins.
* **Objective:** Create and invoke your first custom "skill".
* **Task:** Take a simple GET endpoint from one of your existing APIs, author a basic OpenAPI specification for it, and register it as a plugin in Copilot Studio. Test its invocation using natural language that matches the `description` in your spec.
 
#### **Step 3: Architect for Scale (The Strategist)**
 
* **Action:** Watch the Microsoft Power Platform vision video.
* **Objective:** Shift your mindset from building a bot to designing an AI system.
* **Task:** On a whiteboard, re-imagine a significant business process with a Copilot at the center. Instead of coding the conversation, define the 3-5 core **Plugins** (e.g., `GetOrderStatus`, `ApproveRefund`) the system would need. This exercise solidifies the concept of Generative Actions and prepares you to design scalable solutions.
